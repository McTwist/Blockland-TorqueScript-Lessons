\section{Introduction}

Learning a programming language is fairly straightforward. This document will go through the basics that will make it easier to learn any language. All languages may have different syntax or special oddities and curls, but in general this document will make sure that the mindset of a programmer will be set and then apply it. Keep in mind that all future documents will contain specialized content toward TorqueScript while this will only be the basics of the basics. No code in here exists in any existing language, but are more used to make generalized algorithms made as a hint of how a program should work.

\textit{Keep in mind that this lesson is only about the theory of programming. Actual TorqueScript code is done in the next lessons.}
