Copy-paste this piece of code in the console of Blockland to get all functions that exists that moment. Read and try to understand some of them, especially those that are after the first block of functions.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ts]
dumpConsoleFunctions();
\end{lstlisting}

Then type in this to get all available objects and their methods. This is only optional and could be skipped, but left here to make it easier to follow on the next lesson.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ts]
dumpConsoleClasses();
\end{lstlisting}

The last thing to try out is to first create an object of any type, and then call the method of dump on it. This will give all variables and available methods for that specific object.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ts]
$obj = new ScriptObject();
$obj.name = "James";
$obj.dump();
\end{lstlisting}
