\section{Introduction}

Starting now, every lessons programming language will be taught in TorqueScript. At first this might be daunting, due to the nature that the language is in itself quite verbose. But one should not be afraid of its shenanigans, as that is the true challenge of a programmer: To know its limitations and try to exploit them. All lessons from here-on-out will use the infamous \textit{Appendix A Reference} as a reference~\cite{tsappendix}.

There is always different ways of how code may be written. Both for how many ways a problem could be solved, but also for how a piece of code could visually look to make the reading of it more appealing. One should take note when reading others code that there may be both bad or good ways of doing this. This document will contain the one that is preferred for the writer, but the reader may apply their own standard as they see fit.
