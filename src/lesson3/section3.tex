\section{Object Initializer}

There is actually one more way to create an object and all its variables.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ts]
$obj = new ScriptObject()
{
	name = "James";
	age = 56;
};
\end{lstlisting}

This will make it easier to initialize objects without having to refer to the object itself.
